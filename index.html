<h1>Why New York City Rocks</h1>
<h3>A small dedication to my favorite city.</h3><br>

<img src="images/nyc.jpg" alt="New York City buildings">

<p>The Big Apple gets a bad rap sometimes but it has more going for it than against. Let's explore why. (Hint: Some of that is <em>pizza</em>.)</p>

<div>
	<p>Whether it's the smell or the traffic, people find reasons to complain why New York City is a horrible place to live. Well, they're wrong. They should start looking at all of the positives that drive people to somehow pay the crazy rent. For example:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>No car needed.</li>
			<li>Most things are within walking distance</li>
			<li>Any type of food you can imagine</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<div>
<p>The city is made up of 5 boroughs and each has its own attractions. Here are just a few of my favorite:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Borough</th>
		<th colspan="4">Attraction</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Manhattan</td>
		<td>Grand Central Terminal, The Sheep's Meadow at Central Park, Doyer's Street</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Brooklyn</td>
		<td>Williamsburg, McGlorick Park, DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge Park</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Queens</td>

	</tr>
