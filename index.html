<h1>Why New York City Rocks</h1>
<h3>A small dedication to my favorite city.</h3><br>

<img src="images/nyc.jpg" alt="New York City buildings">

<p>The Big Apple gets a bad rap sometimes but it has more going for it than against. Let's explore why.<br> (Hint: Some of that is <em>pizza</em>.)</p>

<section>
	<p>Whether it's the smell or the traffic, people find reasons to complain why New York City is a horrible place to live. <br>Well, they're wrong. They should start looking at all of the positives that drive people to somehow pay the crazy rent. <br>For example:</p>

		<ul class="nyc_perks">
			<li>No car needed</li>
			<li>Most things are within walking distance</li>
			<li>Any type of food you can imagine</li>
		</ul>

<p>The city is made up of 5 boroughs and each has its own attractions. Here are just a few of my favorite:</p>

	<table id="borough_table" border="1">
		<tr>
			<th>Borough</th>
			<th>Attraction</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Manhattan</td>
			<td>Grand Central Terminal, The Sheep's Meadow at Central Park, Doyer's Street</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Brooklyn</td>
			<td>Williamsburg, McGlorick Park, DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge Park</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Queens</td>
			<td>MoMa PS1, Astoria, Chinatown, Ridgewood</td>
		</tr>

		</tr>

		</tr>
